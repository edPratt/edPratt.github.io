        <p>After hearing about JSONResume years ago, I finally decided to use it. It's actually really nice once you get it up and running.<i>
            <br>
            <br>
            Went from this ...
            <br>
            <img src="/assets/old_resume_example.png" alt="Resume" style="width:400px;height:400px;">
            <br>
            <br>
            To This ...
            <br>
            <img src="/assets/json_resume_example.png" alt="Resume" style="width:400px;height:400px;">

        <br>
        <br>
        Now, if I want to change the format I just run one simple command. If I want to change the content I just edit a json file and run a command. No more Word or Pages, woot.

        <p>I think I finally need to make a new resume because my current one is garbage. /resume coming soon, hopefully.<i> - EP</i></p>

        <p>I really wasn't sure about doing one of these. With social media and all it seems like a lost cause; an archaic method of transmitting ideas, but I guess that's why I've now come to like the process. There are no likes, no shares, there are just words. There are less distractions. It's simple. #KISS <i> - EP </p>
